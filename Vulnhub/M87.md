# M87

## Description

m87 is a simple machine, created specifically to be exploited. 

### Let's Begin

First we are going to use the commandline utility arp-scan to scan our network to discover the target IP address.

Now that we have our target IP (192.168.1.110), we can take the next step, enumeration and scan open ports. To perform the scan we will use the tool nmap. 

#### nmap -A -T4 -p- 192.168.1.110

-A: Turns on the version detection

-T4: Agressive scanning

-p-: scan all 65535 ports

The scan's result as we can see shows us that the ports 22 (SSH), 80 (HTTP) and 9090 (Open ssl/zeus-admin) are open. Since the port 80 is open we can try to open this IP in our browser.

When we open the web page all we have is a form in blank page. So let's see if there is some more directories. For this directory fuzzing we can use the tool dirbuster

As we can see, several directories were found. So, let's explore! We start by /admin/index.php that contains another form

But here we notice two things. First we have an index.php page, when we write index.php?id=1 we get a error saying "You have an error in your SQL syntax; ". But when we write, for example, id=1, we get a name! This name is stored in some database from the victim's server.

And second, when we submit some random credentials in the form we see that the form use the HTTP GET method, wich is not advice when dealing with sensitive data.

From the dirbuster scan we got another sub-directory /admin/backup, wich has another form with the HTTP GET method...

Since we already found out that the server is vulnerable to SQL Injection, we can use the tool SQL MAP to see if we can discover and/or extract some databases.

- sqlmap http://192.168.1.110/admin/index.php?id=1 --dbs --batch

And hurray! We discover some juicy databases, now lets see what they got.

But we can't login with any of the users... Maybe we can access to the stored files with the command

- sqlmap http://192.168.1.110/admin/index.php?id=1 --file-read=/etc/passwd --batch

In this file we found a user named Charlotte, so we have a user that has access to the server. After trying to brute force with the list of passwords discovered, we finally entered with the password 15The4Dm1n4L1f3!

And we got one exploit for Samba. This exploit allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (system crash) via an & (ampersand) character in a Process ID High header field in a NEGOTIATE PROTOCOL REQUEST packet.
In this output we obtain the Samba version. So let's find more exploits.

We execute it and then we got root access!
